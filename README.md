## Workflows

This repository contains reusable workflows for the [eclipse-tractusx](https://github.com/eclipse-tractusx) GitHub
organization. Their intent is to make the adoption of Eclipse Tractus-X processes and guidelines easier.

See the [official documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-workflows/reusing-workflows) on reusable workflows and specifically the part about
[calling reusable workflows](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-workflows/reusing-workflows#calling-a-reusable-workflow)
for further information. The following sections describe the reusable workflows provided in this repository and also show
examples on how to use them.
